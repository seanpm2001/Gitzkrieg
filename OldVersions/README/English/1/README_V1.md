# Gitzkrieg

A butchering of the German word Blitzkrieg (Blitz: Lightning,  Krieg: War)

Gitzkrieg (Gitz: Git lightning, Krieg: War)

For now, the z is just going to mean lightning, even though it doesn't make linguistic sense.

## Attempted linguistic fixes:

- Glitzkrieg
- Gitzenkrieg
- Gitzlenkrieg
